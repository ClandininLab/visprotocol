control: set up triggering on each epoch vs. epoch run
gui: ignore_warnings?
Base devices:
    - trigger fxn
    - example for nidaq and labjack?
data: client bucket. Is this for something? Maybe save out current cfg settings?

- re-incorporate locomotion stuff. Is it enough to have a dedicated keyword param in the protocol?

Example lab package:
    - example user config and protocols
    - way to link from core to lab package for cfg and protocols
